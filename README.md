This initiative aims to combat hunger and malnutrition among underprivileged individuals and families by providing them with nutritious and sufficient food. Through partnerships with local farmers, restaurants, and food suppliers, we collect surplus or donated food, prepare balanced meals, and distribute them to those in need.
